## Review Process

### Each member will:
- Create a feature branch for their task.
- Push the code to GitHub and open a Pull Request (PR) to `main`.
- Request a review from their assigned reviewer.

### The reviewer will:
- Comment on code style, logic, and functionality in the PR.
- Suggest specific improvements.

### The coder will:
- Commit changes based on feedback in the same PR.
- Reply to comments explaining the resolution.

### The reviewer will:
- Re-check and **approve** the PR if changes are satisfactory.
- The PR will then be merged to `main`.
